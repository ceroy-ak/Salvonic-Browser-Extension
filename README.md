# Salvonic Browser Extension

The Browser extension is for both Chromium and Mozilla browsers.
The main purpose of this extension is to provide faster access to the services for the Stakeholders.

Whenever a user with the plugin opens a new tab either by mouse or keyboard, the user is presented with a predifined page from which the user can easily reach the websites.

The extension was made during my Internship period at Salvonic Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
